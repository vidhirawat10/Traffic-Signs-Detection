## ðŸ§  About

The goal of this project is to build a model capable of recognizing traffic signs to enhance autonomous vehicle systems and driver assistance applications. The project was developed as part of an internship assignment.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- **Source:** [German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)](https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/gtsrb_news.html)
- **Classes:** 43 unique traffic sign categories.
- **Size:** ~50,000 images with annotations.
- **Preprocessing:**  
  - Resized to 32x32 pixels  
  - Normalized pixel values  
  - One-hot encoded labels

## ðŸ§° Model Architecture

The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras with the following architecture:

Input Layer (32x32x3)<br>
â†’ Conv2D (32 filters, 3x3)<br>
â†’ ReLU<br>
â†’ MaxPooling (2x2)<br>
â†’ Conv2D (64 filters, 3x3)v
â†’ ReLU<br>
â†’ MaxPooling (2x2)<br>
â†’ Flatten<br>
â†’ Dense (128)<br>
â†’ Dropout (0.5)<br>
â†’ Output Layer (Softmax - 43 classes)<br>
